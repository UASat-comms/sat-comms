1. ran "installDependencies" first
2. Made sure /boot/config.txt had enable_uart=1 AND core_freq=250
3. ran "sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service"
4. ran "sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service"
5. Made sure /boot/cmdline.txt did not have "console="serial,XX...XX"
6. Added "dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt" to set BlueTooth to the mini-uart while
   the serial connection will get the nice, fast ttyAMA0 uart.
7. Reboot.
