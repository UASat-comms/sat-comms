# System Configuration
1. ran "installDependencies" first
2. Made sure /boot/config.txt had enable_uart=1 AND core_freq=400 
    -> (core_freq=250 is default for RPi 1 & 2, core_freq=400 for RPi 3)
    -> core_freq=400 was set because UART gets its clock as a derivative
       of the gpu core frequency; therefore, if the sender & receiver have
       too different clock rates then issues might arise.
3. ran "sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyS0.service"
4. ran "sudo systemctl disable serial-getty@ttyS0.service"
5. Made sure /boot/cmdline.txt did not have "console="serial,XX...XX"
6. Added "dtoverlay=pi3-miniuart-bt" to set BlueTooth to the mini-uart while
   the serial connection will get the nice, fast ttyAMA0 uart.
7. Reboot.

# Program Configuration (In the code)
8. changed "/dev/ttys0" to "/dev/serial0"
9. Set baud rate to 9600 (for now).

Okay, so running serial_test.c with these steps, the serialOpen() call does not fail -> serial is working.
